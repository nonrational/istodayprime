# is today prime?

> Today’s a prime day. Whether you write the date in American (MMDDYY), European (DDMMYY), or ISO (YYYYMMDD) format, you get a prime. That is, 112913 and 291113 and 20131129 are all prime numbers.
>
> We’ll call a date an American prime date if MMDDYY is prime, a European prime date if DDMMYY is prime, and an ISO prime date if YYYYMMDD is prime. (Single-digit days and months are padded with a zero.) If a date is prime by all three criteria, we’ll call it an international prime date. Today is an international prime date, and there won’t be another one until August 11, 2019.
>
> If a date is an American prime date and a European prime date, we’ll call it a transatlantic prime date. After today, the next transatlantic prime dates are December 4 and 13 this year. There will be no transatlantic prime dates in 2014, 2015, and 2016 since these dates correspond to numbers that are divisible by either 2 or 5. The first transatlantic prime date of 2017 will be January 16.
